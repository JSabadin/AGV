# Advanced Ground Vehicle (AGV) Control and Navigation System

## Project Overview
This repository contains a sophisticated robotic system project designed for an Advanced Ground Vehicle (AGV). The system integrates various functionalities, each developed in Python and interfacing with the Robot Operating System (ROS).

### Key Features
- **Odometry**: Implements odometry for precise motion tracking of the AGV.
- **Kalman Filtering**: Utilizes Kalman filtering for accurate localization within the environment.
- **Control Mechanisms**: Incorporates advanced control algorithms to guide the AGV to designated reference points.
- **Line Following**: Features a line-following algorithm for guided navigation along predefined paths.
- **Path Planning**: Employs the A* algorithm for efficient and effective path planning.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Robot Operating System (ROS)
